# Data-Analytics-Portfolio


# Hi there, I'm Buhle Damane 👋

## About Me

I'm a multidisciplinary professional born and raised in **South Africa**, where I currently reside. My background spans law, technology, and data — a combination that gives me a unique perspective on how data and digital solutions can serve people and drive meaningful decisions.

I hold an **LLB from the University of Venda** and am currently advancing my studies with a **Master's in Human Rights Law at the University of South Africa (UNISA)**. My passion for continuous learning led me to expand into the tech space — completing a **Data Analytics programme with ALX (2024–2025)** and a **coding bootcamp with SheCodes (2023–present)**, where I earned multiple certificates across web development, Python, and AI.

I'm someone who genuinely loves learning new things and constantly improving my skills. On my free time, you'll find me at choir practice, swimming, or spending time with family. And when it comes to "fun" in the professional sense — I love revisiting the basics, because it's easy to forget the fundamentals that hold everything together.
