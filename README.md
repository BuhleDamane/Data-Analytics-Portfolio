# Data-Analytics-Portfolio


# Hi there, I'm Buhle Damane 👋

## About Me

I was born and raised in South Africa, and it's where I currently call home. My background is a bit of a mix — I studied law, got into coding, and found my way into data analytics, and honestly I wouldn't have it any other way. Each discipline has shaped how I think and approach problems.

I have an LLB from the University of Venda, and I'm currently working towards my Master's in Human Rights Law at the University of South Africa (UNISA). Alongside that, I completed a Data Analytics programme with ALX (2024 to 2025), and I've been part of the SheCodes Bootcamp since 2023, where I've picked up skills in web development, Python, and AI.

I genuinely enjoy learning new things, and I make a point of going back to practice what I've already learned because it's easy to lose the basics if you're not careful. Outside of work and studying, I sing in my church choir, go swimming, and spend time with my family.
