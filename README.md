# Hi there, I'm Buhle Damane 👋

## About Me

I was born and raised in South Africa, and it's where I currently call home. My background is a bit of a mix — I studied law, got into coding, and found my way into data analytics, and honestly I wouldn't have it any other way. Each discipline has shaped how I think and approach problems.

I have an LLB from the University of Venda, and I'm currently working towards my Master's in Human Rights Law at the University of South Africa (UNISA). Alongside that, I completed a Data Analytics programme with ALX (2024 to 2025), and I've been part of the SheCodes Bootcamp since 2023, where I've picked up skills in web development, Python, and AI.

I genuinely enjoy learning new things, and I make a point of going back to practice what I've already learned because it's easy to lose the basics if you're not careful. Outside of work and studying, I sing in my church choir, go swimming, and spend time with my family.

## 💼 Projects & Work

This portfolio holds data analysis projects I've worked on, covering different tools and topics:

**Project 1: Gender Inequality Index — Global Analysis Across 194 Countries, 1990–2021**
I analysed 31 years of gender inequality data across 194 countries to understand where inequality is worst and what drives it. The strongest finding was how closely gender inequality tracks with a country's overall human development — poverty, low literacy, and inequality move together as a system. On the hopeful side, global average inequality dropped 34% over three decades, and the UAE improved by 92.6%, showing that rapid change is possible with real political will behind it.

**Project 2: Violence Against Women and Girls — Attitudes Across 70 Countries, 2000–2017**
This was survey data from 70 countries on whether people believe a husband is justified in using violence against his wife. The finding that stood out most: in nearly 89% of the surveyed countries, women justify violence against themselves at a higher rate than men do. Education came through as one of the most reliable protective factors, though in a handful of countries it had the opposite effect — which suggests the education system there may be reinforcing the very beliefs it should be challenging.

**Project 3: Amazon India Sales — E-Commerce Performance Across 120,000+ Orders**
I worked through 16 SQL queries across five business questions on a real Amazon India dataset covering 120,000+ orders. The most important finding was a 14.21% cancellation rate concentrated in the highest-revenue states and most valuable products — a measurable revenue leak sitting right at the heart of operations. I also identified B2B customers as an underserved segment: fewer orders than B2C, but 15% higher spend per order and far fewer cancellations.

I've also written legal articles and built web projects through my SheCodes journey. Each one has taught me something, and I keep adding to this as I go.

## 🌍 Open to Opportunities

I'm looking for roles in Business Analysis, Data Analysis, or anything that connects to what I know and do. I'm based in South Africa, but I'm very open to remote work, contracts, and part-time roles as well.
